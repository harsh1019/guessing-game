// what is DOM ?

// DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL: structured representation of
//  html document allows js to access html elements
// and styles to manipulate them
// DOM is basically a connection point bw js and html css content

/*********************************IMPORTANT */
// all the dom methods and properties used to manipulate dom are not part of java script.
// Remember that JavaScript is actually just a dialect
// of the ECMAScript specification,
// and all this DOM related stuff is simply not in there.

// Well, the DOM and DOM methods
// are actually part of something called the web APIs.
// So the web API APIs are like libraries
// that browsers implement
// and that we can access from our JavaScript code.
// And API stands for Application Programming Interface.
// these libraries automatically available for us to use.
// So all this happens behind the scenes,
// we don't have to import or do anything, okay?
